**Blehyr's Balatro Cards**

NOTE: This is just a sprite sheet that you can replace in the game's files to change the appearance of the cards. They will replace the default cards.

I use 7-zip for this
1. Go to your Balatro local files and right click Balatro.exe and then 'open archive' using 7-zip
2. Navigate to Resouces > Textures > 2x
3. Replace 8BitDeck_opt2.png with the downloaded file. This is CASE SENSITIVE so please make sure the file name is correct
4. Launch the game, and set both 'High Contrast Cards' and 'Pixel Art Smoothing' to ON
5. On the Customize Deck screen, set all cards to Default
